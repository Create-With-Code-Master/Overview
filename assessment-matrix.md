## Design Process

## Game Programming Fundamentals

* Declare variables:
  - Type
  - Access
  - Primative types
  - Objects
  - Arrays
* Call methods

## Prototype 1

* Navigate the 3D space and the Unity Editor comfortably
* Add and manipulate objects in the scene to position them where you want, including the camera
* Control the layout of Unity Editor to suit your needs
* Create C# scripts and apply them to objects
* Use Visual Studio and a few of its basic features
* Add Rigidbody and Collider components to allow objects to collide realistically 
* Declare variables properly and initialize/assign them with appropriate access modifiers

## Prototype 2

* Create an if-then statement in order to implement basic logic in your project, including the use of greater than (>) and less than (<) operators
* Transform a gameobject into a prefab that can be instantiated into the scene
* Work with prefabs to add efficiencies in your workflows
* Get user input with GetKey and KeyCode to test for specific keyboard presses
* Use arrays to create an accessible list of objects or values and randomly select an object from that array
* Randomly generate values to randomize spawn positions
* Change the cameraâ€™s perspective to better suit your game
* Repeat functions on a timer with InvokeRepeating
* Write custom methods to make your code more readable
* Detect collisions and destroy objects that collide with each other
* Display messages in the console with Debug Log

## Prototype 3

## Prototype 4

## Prototype 5
