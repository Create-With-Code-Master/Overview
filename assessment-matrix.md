## Game Programming Fundamentals

## Prototype 1

* Navigate the 3D space and the Unity Editor comfortably
* Add and manipulate objects in the scene to position them where you want, including the camera
* Control the layout of Unity Editor to suit your needs
* Create C# scripts and apply them to objects
* Use Visual Studio and a few of its basic features
* Add Rigidbody and Collider components to allow objects to collide realistically 
* Declare variables properly and initialize/assign them with appropriate access modifiers

## Prototype 2

## Prototype 3

## Prototype 4

## Prototype 5
